# minishell

[group project with [@benzlinger](https://github.com/benzlinger)]

This project was about creating a simple shell. We learned a lot about processes and file descriptors.

The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT. At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating.
It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat
close to the human language.
Thanks to this project, we were able to travel through time and come back to problems
people faced when Windows didnâ€™t exist.
